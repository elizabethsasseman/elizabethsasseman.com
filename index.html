            Hello!
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio! My name's
            Elizabeth (or Liz for short) and I have over 5 years of design
            experience. I would consider myself a pattern-oriented, creative
            design engineer who thrives in environments where a lot needs to be
            figured out.
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            I am focused on creating and capturing simplicity through research
            and user-centric design. I have the ability to see big picture vison
            and think through loose ideas, and then turn those ideas into
            designs first, and code next. I have experience collaborating with a
            variety of individuals and teams, including other designers,
            front-end & back-end engineers, stakeholders, marketing teams, product owners, and
            product managers. I've worked on eCommerce and SaaS technologies, on both large Agile/Lean 
            teams as well as for small start-ups where there's a lot to build
            from scratch.
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            I am incredibly motivated by new ideas and other curious and
            passionate people who love to think outside the box. Acting as a
            solid bridge between design and development, my skills expand
            extensively into both realms. I have the ability to think through
            front-end constraints as I design, and to code while maintaining a
            true eye for visual balance and usability.
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            My brain thinks both ways, and I see this as my greatest asset.
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            My goal is to help build successful and intuitive technology with
            other people who's values like mine, align with bettering the world
            and other people's lives in some way. I am interested in UX design
            thinking, UI development, front-end engineering, finding and
            creating patterns, building systems, minimizing user effort, and
            designing attractive and intuitive interfaces.
          </p>
          <p class="px-3">
            Outside of technology, my interests are expansive. The things that
            keep me alive include thinking through ideas, mountain running and
            adventuring, working in the garden, solving mechanical puzzles,
            taking photos, cooking & eating healthy food, painting, and learning
            about permaculture design, regenerative agriculture, landscape
            design, architecture, interior design, industrial design,
            astrophysics, and biomimicry.
