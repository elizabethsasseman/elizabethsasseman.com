                      <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">After watching my family struggle to find important paperwork related
                        to a loved one's estate, it became apparent that a simple process did not exist in the realm of
                        estate-planning or in settling someone's estate. Initially I wanted to build a product designed to streamline
                          the process of working with an estate-planning attorney. And throughout this journey, the vision
                          of my product evolved to include a platform where value between clients and attorneys would be
                          exchanged.</p>

                        I wanted to showcase my ability to problem-solve
                        and come up with some ideas that would help refine the app and make it very user-friendly. The UX part of UX|UI design is all about understanding
                        users on a personal level. It's important to research, brainstorm, create a story, and then build, test, and refine based on real
                        data. I have provided some visuals I created using various UX techniques. Because the purpose of this project is to showcase my UX skills, the research I did was primarily based off of my own
                        personal thoughts and feelings and the thoughts and feelings of a couple close friends who use the app frequently.</p>

                        <p class="alegreya300 px-3">I was born and raised in Indiana, and moved out to Colorado the minute
                        I graduated from Indiana University. I couldn't think of anything except the beautiful mountains I wanted to spend
                        forever exploring. I grew up trying every sport I could, but rock climbing and trail running were the two big ones that
                        stuck. Since moving to Colorado I've also gotten more into alpine climbing, downhill skiing, nordic skiing, and mountain biking. I spent a few
                        years running long ultra-distance races, and although I'm still psyched on the occasional big race, my heart is drawn more
                        and more to off-trail adventures up lesser-known mountains. I also love gardening. There is something so incredible
                        about planting seeds, caring for them, watching them grow, and then enjoying the delicious and organic taste of fresh vegetables and fruits.</p>
                        <p class="alegreya300 px-3">Aside from my strong desire to be outdoors in beautiful and wild places is my
                        intellectual desires. The older I get, the more amazed I am at the human ability to learn and to teach oneself. Most of the
                        books I read are non-fiction and with the purpose of learning something. I love to think, analyze and brainstorm. I think of
                        myself as a designer at my core, inside and outside of work. I have a list of product ideas and business ideas that I keep
                        tucked away, and am currently working on a couple of them for fun on the side. I would not be myself without intellectual
                        stimulation. I am a very creative person but I am also a very analytical person, and I think the combination is what makes
                        me a designer. My interest in UX design doesn't end with technology. I spend time considering the impact of applying the principles
                        of UX design to all areas of life, such as with interior living spaces, cooking and eating foods, and in the development of physical products.
                        I am also passionate about creating positive user experiences through communication on a personal level. The client experience
                        is just as important offline as it is online.</p>
                        <p class="alegreya300 px-3">Professionally, I am skilled at taking ideas from design to prototype. I am incredibly motivated by innovative collaboration,
                        the freedom to invent and brainstorm, and by passionate people who think outside the box. I have experience working on a team of UX and UI designers, and with engineers,
                        product developers, and tech writers. I have experience working in an iterative Agile environment where I spend time doing UX research, building prototypes, user
                        testing, presenting ideas, and refining designs. I am also a skilled photographer with a keen eye. I have an entrepreneurial mindset
                        and love to wear multiple hats. I want my career to take me in the direction of meaningful work, above all else. And I know I personally could find
                        meaningful work in a number of different roles. It doesn't matter if I'm a designer, managing a team, making a company more organized and efficient, or starting my own business -
                        as long as I'm in a role where I can really impact the success of the company in a positive way, I will feel satisfied.</p>
                        <p class="alegreya300 px-3">I am happy and whole when pushing the physical and intellectual pieces of who I am, as far as
                        I possibly can. Below are a few photos of me in my element.</p>

                        <h2 class="alegreya300 display-5 text-white px-3">Applying This</h2>
                        <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Elizabeth believes incredible user experiences are largely due
                        to a designers understanding of the psychology of what people want. Designs have to come from a place of authenticity,
                        open-mindedness, and creative problem-solving. Great designers are inventive and able to pursue a design because it's what
                        the user wants, not because it's what the business wants. The same solution doesn't always work for different
                        scenarios and sometimes the most important thing is to take a step
                        back and observe the big picture. Designers are psychologists in a way - to understand the user is the biggest priority.
                        There might not be an ideal solution when everyone is working within the
                        constraints of poor research, bad website architecture, or a lack of user understanding. Great designers put the user first and work hard to understand his or her
                        needs, desires, fears, struggles, and thoughts. Users are people, and the best designers can do is continually remember this.</p>

                        <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Elizabeth is continually curious and invested in learning and understanding users and their
                          experiences. Her particular areas of interest include more than just designing experiences with technology. Below are a few
                          additional ways she considers UX:</p>
                        <ul class="alegreya300 mr-3 text-white ml-3">
                          <li>She has spent time studying architecture and interior design in order to apply the process
                            of UX design to the process of moving into and living inside a home. Just as there are users of technology,
                            we are all users of a home.</li>
                          <li>She loves to experiment with food while cooking. She has recently begun brainstorming how UX can
                            be applied to the art of everything having to do with food. We all know there's an art to preparing how food
                            looks on a plate, but the experience extends beyond the way it looks visually.</li>
                          <li>She is always curious about how things work. She is very mechanically-minded, has keen spatial
                            abilities, and loves to fix things. All of this draws her to the art of developing physical products. Elizabeth
                            is currently working on a particular chalk bag design idea for rock climbing.</li>
