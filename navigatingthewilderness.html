              <h2 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Brainstorming</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I spent some time thinking about the usability of the app and took notes on
              some items I think could use a closer look. I feel brainstorming is a crucial part of the UX process and although I'm starting
              with it here in the beginning of my evaluation, I do it iteratively and throughout the entire extent of a given project. Gathering an endless list of thoughts and ideas
              ensures there is never an end to the number of items worth analyzing.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">The following is a list of thoughts, observations, and questions related to my use and some friends' use of the app.
              It should be noted that this is not meant to be a negative critique of everything I feel is wrong with the app. Instead,
              this is simply a part of the process of analyzing the user experience.</p>
              <ul class="alegreya300 mr-3 text-white ml-3">
                <li>The list under the plus icon in the top navigation seems to have all of the leftover items that wouldn't fit anywhere else.</li>
                <li>What is the purpose of the eye icon that turns off and on a saved route?</li>
                <li>There is no "undo" after creating a waypoint. User has to tap twice and delete. Ways to eliminate clicks?</li>
                <li>Not immediately obvious that the green roads are roads.</li>
                <li>Will route way around over going off trail a very short distance.</li>
                <li>Options to close loop quickest way when creating a route, for example?</li>
                <li>No confirmation message after saving a new route.</li>
                <li>Expansion icon in a very prominent place in top nav, but not a primary action.</li>
                <li>Some icons lead user to bottom sheet modal, while others to centered modal. Reason for inconsistency?</li>
                <li>Legend not very obvious, and not always available to view (such as in creating a route).</li>
                <li>Cancel link is gray, while Save link is green.</li>
                <li>Search icon and discover icon - similar actions but exist in two places.</li>
                <li>Do users Expand preview map or show on main map more often? Is it necessary to have these two separate actions or could they be combined?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Below are a few quick sketches to help visualize some of my points above:</p>

              <h2 class="alegreya300 px-3">Product & Project Management</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 px-3">A list of items can be put together, like in my case above, from first impressions made by
              an individual or a small group of friends. But it's important to confirm through some form of user testing whether these are thoughts shared by a large
              number of people that represent the app's primary user base, or whether they're thoughts shared by just a few people or the smallest portion of the app's user base.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 px-3">With a list of items and some user data on these items, the process of breaking these items down
              into a project timeline based on business needs can begin. This helps sort out which items are most critical to work on, and which items
              can be pushed to the backlog.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 px-3">With a project timeline in place, work can begin on the more critical items.</p>

              <h2 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">User Flows</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">There are dozens different UX methods designers use to analyze a user experience,
              and there are different reasons for using each method, but the purpose is always to gain a better
              user understanding and to solve a problem. Not all methods are used for every situation, so I don't
              plan to touch on all of them here. Instead, I plan to describe how I'd utilize some of the more popular methods,
              and why they might be helpful in bringing us closer to a solution.</p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">User flows are helpful in seeing the big picture. A user flow depicts a series of
              actions a user might take to get to a desired outcome within an app. Not only do user flows help designers see the big picture and
              what problems exist, they also help non-designers understand why certain design decisions are being made. User flows can vary
              in detail and can be roughly sketched, or created by using an online tool.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">I've sketched out a rough user flow (below) that helps depict two main actions a user might
              want to take within the app. Although we'd want to confirm through user testing what the main actions actually are, I'm going to
              assume for the sake of this example that creating a route and searching for a route are two main user actions. The ability to see what's going on from overhead helps me note any sticky spots in a user's
              journey through the app. For example, in taking a look at the beginning of a user's journey to create a route (on the left), I notice the action a user needs to take
              to create a route is hidden within the "+" icon menu. To me this is a potential sticky point in a user's journey. A user won't be able to
              create a new route if he/she can't find the action button to do so. If user testing confirms that this is
              a sticky point for a majority of users, it's possible relocating the "create a route" action to a more prominent location could be a good solution.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">If it turns out this hidden action is a huge problem, it's possible a more detailed user flow
              would be beneficial to create for just the "create a route" action. Especially if describing the problem at hand to stakeholders in
              an easy-to-understand way in order to get buy-in is critical.

              <h2 class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Personas</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">An individual persona is a fictional representation of a population of users, based on research.
              They are helpful in understanding the needs, wants, pain points, motivations, and fears of these different populations
              of users. Just because one person feels some way about something, doesn't mean a majority of people feel the same way.
              Personas do a great job of telling designers a story from the perspective of a group of users who all feel the same way.
              Great designs for an app aren't created without a thorough understanding of the very people who will be using the app.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">Below are two personas I created. They are very general representations of two likely
              user populations of the app. My first fictional character is Jon. He is based on a combination of peole I know who all use the app
              for a similar purpose. It should be noted that this is not necessarily based on an actual population of Gaia users. I would need access
              to research to determine what populations of users exist. But for the purpose of displaying my ability to create personas, I'm merely
              suggesting that Jon could represent an actual population of users. My second fictional character is Jamie. She is based on what I
              imagine might be another type of population of users.
              </p>
              <p class="alegreya300 text-white px-3">In studying each of these, we gain a greater understanding of these two
              different populations of users and are better equipped to make logical design decisions. For example, if Jon represents approximately
              90% of users, we know our focus in designing should be tailored more toward his motivations and fears (such as high-end technology that
              doesn't fail), as opposed to Jamie's motivations and fears.

              <h2 class="alegreya300 px-3">Additional Methods</h2>
              <p class="alegreya300 px-3">Like I mentioned, there are dozens of methods UX designers use to research and
              better understand users. I described how I might apply brainstorming, user flows, and personas to researching and understand
              users of the app better above. But the following is a list of additional UX methods and what they're used for:
              </p>
              <ul class="alegreya300 mr-3 ml-3">
                <li>Journey Maps: could be used to better understand how users feel during different stages of particular actions.</li>
                <li>Competitive Audit: would be helpful in analyzing competitors and in better understanding industry standards.</li>
                <li>Stakeholder Interviews: helpful in learning more about business needs and goals and in prioritizing them.</li>
                <li>Moodboards: might be beneficial in finding design inspiration and in creating a style guide.</li>
                <li>Storyboards: a way to visually depict a real-life scenario and the actions the user takes.</li>
                <li>Task Analysis: a way to analyze a series of tasks realted to a particular action, and whether they system is intuitive.</li>
                <li>Sitemap: a diagram of the apps structure and navigation - useful in analyzing problematic areas of the architecture.</li>
                <li>Product/Features Roadmap: useful in visualizing priorities and in determining what needs to happen next.</li>
                <li>Use Cases & Scenarios: is helpful in thinking through and recognizing all possible user scenarios in interacting with the app.</li>
                <li>User Testing: comes in so many forms (user interviews, focus groups, a/b testing, surveys, usability tests, card sorting, eyetracking,
                accessibility analysis, etc.), and is useful in confirming whether a design is intuitive and user friendly or whether it needs to go
                back to the drawing board.</li>
                <li>Wireframe: could be used to represent the structure of a page before creating a more detailed mockup.</li>
                <li>Prototypes: could be used to test and determine whether a feature is ready for development.</li>
              </ul>
